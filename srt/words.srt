Today,

8
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:05,278
we

9
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:05,419

10
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:05,899
venturing

11
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:06,260

12
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,500
into

13
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,600
the

15
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:07,702
fascinating

16
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:08,082
and

17
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:08,483
perhaps

18
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:08,663
the

19
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:08,883
most

20
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:09,524
frightening

25
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:11,227

00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:12,328
We

27
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:12,448
are

28
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:13,069

31
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,371
silent

self-sabotage,

43
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:19,939
and

44
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,079
the

45
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:20,820

00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:28,182
Today

56
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:28,362
we

57
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:28,523

58
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,224

59
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:29,745
the

60
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:30,247
shadow.

61
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:31,750
In

You

87
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:44,276
see,

Jung's

94
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,200
is

95
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:47,661
geared

96
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,022
towards

115
00:00:59,541 --> 00:00:59,621
And

shadow.

132
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:08,653
It

133
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:09,074
serves

134
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:09,315
as

135
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:09,515
the

00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:10,897
gatekeeper

138
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:11,238
to

00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:13,362
To

shadow

146
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:14,644

constantly

156
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:18,892
undermined

00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:21,417
But

00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:44,618
it,

219
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:45,439
thereby

220
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,980
finding

221
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:46,822
authentic

222
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:47,243
meaning

223
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:47,363
and

224
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:47,844
power

225
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:47,964
at

226
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:48,204
any

227
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:48,605
age.

228
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:50,248
First,

229
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:51,049
let's

230
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,670
establish

231
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:51,871
a

232
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,391
clear

233
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:53,333
definition.

234
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:54,735
The

235
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:55,437
shadow,

236
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:56,780
contrary

237
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:56,900
to

238
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,421
popular

239
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:57,822
belief,

240
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:58,183
is

241
00:01:58,263 --> 00:01:58,423
not

242
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:58,664
just

243
00:01:58,764 --> 00:01:58,784
a

244
00:01:59,165 --> 00:01:59,826
spiritual

245
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:00,427
metaphor

246
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:00,628
for

247
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:01,289
evil

248
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:01,670
in

249
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:01,790
the

250
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:02,352
traditional

251
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:02,813
religious

252
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,173
sense.

253
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:03,654
It

254
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:03,795
is

255
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:03,895
a

256
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:04,616
clinical,

257
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:05,518
precise

258
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:05,979
term

259
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,440
for

260
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,521
a

261
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:07,302
fundamental

262
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:08,485
psychological

263
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:09,567
reality.

264
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:10,868
The

265
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:11,489
personal

266
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:12,110
shadow

267
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,550
is

268
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,971
simply

269
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:13,151
the

270
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:13,752
aggregate

271
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:13,832

272
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:14,172
all

273
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:14,312
the

274
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:14,973
qualities

275
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:15,414
we

276
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:16,094
repress,

277
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:16,955
reject

278
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:17,376
or

279
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:17,897
deny

280
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:18,017
in

281
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:18,677
ourselves.

282
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:19,659
It

283
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,139
contains

284
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,660
all

285
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:20,840
the

286
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,341
traits

287
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:21,501
and

impulses

289
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:22,682
that

290
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:22,822
are

291
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:23,804
incompatible

292
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:24,224
with

293
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:24,384
our

294
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:24,925
conscious

295
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:25,646
self-image,

296
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:26,106
what

297
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:26,567
Jung

298
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:27,007
called

299
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:27,548
the

300
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:28,269
persona.

301
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,430
That

302
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,911
public

303
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,351
face

304
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:31,212
we

305
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:31,833
carefully

306
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:32,414
construct

307
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:32,554
and

308
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:32,994
present

309
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:33,135
to

310
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:33,255
the

311
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:33,675
world.

312
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:34,857
Think

313
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:35,237
about

314
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:35,718
your

315
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:35,938
own

316
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:36,378
life,

317
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,239
right

318
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,400
from

319
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,700
early

320
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,541
childhood.

321
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:39,586
You

322
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:39,866
learned

323
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:40,247
very

324
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:40,909
quickly

325
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:41,711
which

326
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:42,533
behaviors

327
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:42,734
were

328
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:43,435
acceptable,

329
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:44,538
those

330
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:44,739
that

331
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,120
earned

332
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,300
you

333
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,681
praise

334
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:45,841
from

335
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:46,002
your

336
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:46,423
parents

337
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:46,543
and

338
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:46,984
approval

339
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:47,165
from

340
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:47,867
society,

341
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:48,328
and

342
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:48,548
which

343
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:48,749
were

344
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,852
unacceptable,

345
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:50,834
those

346
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:51,035
that

347
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:51,636
resulted

348
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:51,757
in

349
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:52,378
punishment,

350
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,300
shame,

351
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:53,962
or

352
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:54,724
rejection.

353
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:56,076
The

354
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:56,938
unacceptable

355
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,021
traits,

356
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,141
the

357
00:02:58,322 --> 00:02:58,602
anger,

358
00:02:58,983 --> 00:02:59,083
the

359
00:02:59,164 --> 00:02:59,705
jealousy,

360
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:00,146
the

361
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:00,687
greed,

362
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:01,289
the

363
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,030
laziness,

364
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:02,632
the

365
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:03,213
lust,

366
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,015
were

367
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:04,737
exiled

368
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:04,917
from

369
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:05,058
the

370
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:05,719
conscious

371
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,301
ego

372
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:06,722
and

373
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:07,062
sent

374
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:07,423
down

375
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:07,684
into

376
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:07,804
the

377
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:08,165
depths

378
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:08,245
of

379
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:08,386
the

380
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:09,207
unconscious.

381
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:09,989
It

382
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:10,110
is

383
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,491
there

384
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:10,972
they

385
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:11,673
coalesce

386
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:12,054
to

387
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:12,415
form

388
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:12,555
the

389
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:13,658
shadow.

390
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:13,933
But

391
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,194
here

392
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:14,314
is

393
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:14,455
the

395
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:15,878
crucial

396
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:16,299
and

397
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:16,740
often

398
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,181
deeply

399
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,002
misunderstood

400
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:18,985

00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:19,626
The

403
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:20,248
is

404
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:20,508
not

405
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:20,829
just

406
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:20,909

vices.

410
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:23,114
In

411
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:23,475

421
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:28,326
Consider

422
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:28,947
this.

423
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:29,167
If

it.

703
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:55,855
Instead,

00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,439
incredibly

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,340

itself.

740
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:16,283
Because

Let's

The

a

1081
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:23,077
It

1082
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:23,197
is

1083
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:23,337
the

1117
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,136
not

1133
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:47,819
Integration

1134
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:48,139

This

This

It
